This is the code used in my final year project to design and develop an automated chessboard with autonomous movement and piece identification.

The following libraries are required for the project:

adafruit_ads1x15
adafruit_servokit
pigpio
RPi.GPIO
tkinter
python chess

Stockfish as the chess engine must also be downloaded.
